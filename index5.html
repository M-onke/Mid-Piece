The purple lightsaber color represents wisdom and nobility. This color can technically be used by anyone since it means the user is using both the light and dark side, but it is usually used by Jedi. This color is quite uncommon so the only purple lightsaber user we see in the franchise is Mace Windu. He's also dead by the way.
